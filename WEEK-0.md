#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

The most important thing I did this week to help me pick up JS was pair and mob programming; more generally learning to code as a cohort, rather than individually. I was thinking of things in terms of how effectively I could write code and I am confident I would write better code independently. What I didn't account for was the effectiveness of pair programming when it comes to learning. I found it to be a much less painful and depressing experience compared to getting lost in your own head trying to figure things out solo. Definitely looking forward to further group programming experiencing in the future.
